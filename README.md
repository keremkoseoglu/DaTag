This application features how to embed a custom .NET ActiveX control into SAP GUI. 

A live demo can be seen [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1aVFlIgUWM). Tutorial available [on SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/DrKeremKoseoglu/embedding-custom-activex-controls-into-sap-gui).

 It has two cool features: 
 - A .NET ActiveX control embedded into SAP GUI enables the user to tag apartments on a floor plan (interacts with ABAP)
 - User can dynamically generate Word documents using SAP data - format of the Word file is not fixed, user is able to define his / her own format using smart tags.

 A sibling project representing the same ActiveX embedding logic is [SAPKantar](https://github.com/keremkoseoglu/SAPKantar).
